###Event Recap
For our second Maptime Madison we dove in to online mapping with Open Street Map, learning about not only how to edit and add to OSM but also how to aid in the response to disasters and crises.

[@Ethan](https://twitter.com/ethan_nelson) talked about the importance of [@Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](http://hot.openstreetmap.org/)'s (HOT) work to respond to humanitarian disasters and how to join in on the mapping to provide a more accurate and detailed map for aid workers.  Ethan also made a [task in OSM Task Manager](http://tasks.openstreetmap.us/job/38) to map Madison.

[@Carl](https://twitter.com/northlandiguana) went over the basics of how to edit the OSM Map.  Carl also taught us about attribute tagging and [OSM data structure](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features).

We then had time to edit OSM, where some people chose a [HOT Task](http://hot.openstreetmap.org/) while others filled in information about Madison and their neighborhoods.  It was great fun editing and chatting with everyone about OSM. 

If you missed out on joining us at the [Bubbler](http://madisonbubbler.org/) for OSM mapping, you can view the slides and outline [here](https://github.com/MaptimeMadison/OSM) on our GitHub.
