Maptime Madison is a monthly meetup for anyone that wants to learn about and make maps. People with all levels of mapping experience are encouraged to join. [Maptime](http://www.maptime.io/) is a place for learning and a time to work collaboratively on mapping projects. 

Events will be hosted in the Madison downtown area - locations and times will be posted to this site.  If you have any suggestions about Maptime Madison or want to get involved let us know [@MaptimeMadison](https://twitter.com/MaptimeMadison) or shoot us an email at maptimemadison@gmail.com.
