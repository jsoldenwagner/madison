Want to learn how to make your very own web map? At this next Maptime we will be learning how to make a basic web map using an open source API [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/). Using Leaflet we will cover how to add markers, polygons and lines to our maps and start adding basic interactions. 

New to mapping and or javascript?  No worries, [@KatieKowalsky](http://twitter.com/katiekowalsky) and [@RashaunaMead](http://twitter.com/rashaunamead) will be starting from the beginning. All skill levels are welcomed!  


###Supplies
If you have a laptop that you would want to use please bring it.  Otherwise, we have laptops to borrow supplied to us by the [Bubbler](http://madisonbubbler.org/).  

###When and Where? 
Tuesday May. 19 6pm - 8pm @ Madison Public Library: Central Library @ the Bubbler
