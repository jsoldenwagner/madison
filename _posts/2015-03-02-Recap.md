###Event Recap
We hosted our first meeting in 2015 on CartoDB, an online data vizualization and mapping software.

[@Katie](https://twitter.com/katiekowalsky) talked about the basics of mapping through [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/) and how to get around the website and the different ways you can use this service for manipulating data and visualizing it.

If you missed out on joining us at the [Bubbler](http://madisonbubbler.org/) for learning about CartoDB, you can view the slides and outline [here](https://github.com/MaptimeMadison/CartoDB) on our GitHub. We also have a fabulous tutorial, created by [@Chris](https://twitter.com/chrislhenrick) available [here](https://github.com/MaptimeMadison/cartodb-tutorial) that goes more in depth about CartoDB's advanced SQL features.

###Next Maptime!
Thank you to everyone who came out last night! We will be meeting next on March 11th, to learn about QGIS with [@Robin](https://www.twitter.com/tolomaps). Join our mailing list or follow us on Twitter [@Maptime Madison](@MaptimeMadison) for more news!
