This month at Maptime Madison, we'll be working with the rest of the US Maptime community to help [Missing Maps](http://www.missingmaps.org/), a group of nonprofits dedicated to mapping the world's most vulnerable populations. We'll give a brief introduction of what Missing Maps and [Open Street Map](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) are, how to edit and trace satellite imagery in Open Street Map, and start mapping! If you're unfamiliar with OSM, feel free to go through some of the [Missing Maps' tutorials](http://www.missingmaps.org/contribute/#learn), but we'll spend some time going through the basics.
