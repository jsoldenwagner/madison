Join Maptime this month for Show and Tell and Learn. We'll divide this meetup into two sections: first, we'll have an open floor for you to share a map that you've made to show off your hard work and talk about the processes that went into making it (this is not a formal presentation, no need to prepare anything ahead of time!). If you want you can also share a map that you have seen in the last year or so and talk about why you really like it... or maybe why you dislike it? Basically just a time for us to talk about maps and processes of making them.
Then, we'll have "office hours," or time for you to ask for help or advice on any mapping project you've been working on. We are a friendly bunch, and you do not need to be a map expert - the idea is to provide a supportive environment for you to show off your work and get help. Bring your mapping projects and questions!

###Supplies

If you have a laptop, please feel free to bring it. We will also have about 10 laptops available for people to use.
