At their most basic level, maps are data. Data can be easy to acquire for some maps, but for the majority of interesting or clever ideas it is unlikely that you will find `clever_idea.shp` waiting for you. This talk will go through various ways to find data, geocoding, dealing with inconvenient formats, and how to navigate other issues that may arise using Python and JavaScript. [John Czaplewski](https://twitter.com/johnjcz) will bring his data expertise that he earned through years of finding data on everything from [Olympic athletes](http://www.johnjcz.com/team-usa-sochi/) to [geology](https://macrostrat.org/burwell/#3/40.80/-94.10).
