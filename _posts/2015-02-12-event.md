Do you want to make your own cool, interactive online map? Come to Maptime Madison this Thursday and learn how to create easy interactive maps! At this month's Maptime, we'll learn about [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/), a cloud-based mapping platform that is easy for beginners but also provides advanced functionality for mapping and programming pros. We'll learn from [@KatieKowalsky](https://twitter.com/KatieKowalsky) about getting started with interactive maps. 

Check out the CartoDB gallery to see the types of maps that people are making with this platform. Then you'll get a chance to make your own map, either using your own data or we will provide some. The library provides some laptops, but if you want to bring your own, feel free to do so. Aspiring mapmakers of all levels welcome, including beginners! Be sure to follow us on Twitter [@MaptimeMadison](https://twitter.com/Maptimemadison) to find out about future events.


Everyone is welcome and encouraged to join in on the fun!
