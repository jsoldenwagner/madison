Love maps? Want to learn to make your own? Or perhaps you have been using ArcGIS for years but want to know what else is out there. Join us to learn about QGIS, a free, open-source mapping software.

We'll learn from [@Robin](https://twitter.com/tolomaps) about getting started with QGIS. We'll walk through downloading data from [Natural Earth](https://naturalearthdata.com) and then getting started with making your own map. Or feel free to bring whatever data you want to map, and we'll go through how QGIS works.

The library provides some laptops, but if you want to bring your own, feel free to do so. If you do, we recommend downloading QGIS ahead of time.

Aspiring mapmakers of all levels welcome, including beginners! Be sure to follow us on Twitter [@MaptimeMadison](https://twitter.com/Maptimemadison) to find out about future events.


Everyone is welcome and encouraged to join in on the fun!

Bring a laptop if you want to use your own, otherwise we will have some to borrow.
