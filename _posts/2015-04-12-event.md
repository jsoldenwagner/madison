[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM), the project that creates and distributes free geographic data for the world, is holding its annual Spring Mapathon to improve the quality of the map and to teach people how to add information to OpenStreetMap. Maptime Madison will be holding an outdoor/indoor mapping event for this occasion. 

After a brief introduction to OSM we will survey the area around the Capitol and then reconvene at the Bubbler to add the collected information to the OSM database. This is a great event for both beginners, OSM veterans, and anyone in between -- no prior knowledge required.

###Supplies
Useful things to bring (but not required):
clipboard and pencil for taking notes
smartphone/tablet (we will discuss some useful apps during the introduction)
digital camera (with or without GPS)
GPS receiver
laptop (there will be laptops available at the Bubbler, but maybe you prefer to work on your own machine)
food and drink 


If you have mobility impairments or just plain prefer "armchair mapping," you also have the option of staying at the Bubbler during the survey and improving OSM from there. We will provide some printed maps. Please make sure to RSVP to make planning easier for us.

###When and Where? 
Sunday, April 12th at 1pm @ Madison Public Library: Central Library @ the Bubbler 

201 W Mifflin St Madison, WI 53703
