This month at Maptime, co-organizer [@KatieKowalsky](http://twitter.com/katiekowalsky) will walk through one of her favorite parts of web mapping- creating basemap tiles. Imagine being able to take the Google Maps basemap and design it to look like a pop art painting, a part of your favorite video game, or simply awesome. Katie will be discussing how to use CartoCSS for styling basemaps for web mapping. For this Maptime, we'll be using [Mapbox Studio Classic](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio-classic/#darwin) to play in under Katie's instruction.

###Supplies
If you have a laptop that you would want to use please bring it and download [Mapbox Studio Classic](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio-classic/#darwin) beforehand.  Otherwise, we have laptops to borrow supplied to us by the [Bubbler](http://madisonbubbler.org/).
