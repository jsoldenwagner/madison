###Event Recap
We had a great time learning [QGIS](http://www2.qgis.org/en/site/) with [@Robin](https://twitter.com/#!/tolomaps)!

QGIS is an awesome open source GIS software that we'll definitely be including more lessons on in the future, be sure to check out Robin's slides if you couldn't make it [here](http://www.slides.com/tolomaps/qgis). If you attended this month's meeting and want to find more resources on QGIS, check out the [GIS Stack Exchange](http://gis.stackexchange.com/) or the collection of resources on [Maptime's website](http://maptime.io/lessons-resources/#desktop-mapping).

Thanks again to [CartoDB](http://www.twitter.com/cartodb) for providing us with free pizza for this month's meeting. 

###Next Maptime!
We're so glad we had a packed audience for our QGIS event, we'll be announcing our April meeting very shortly. Join our mailing list or follow us on Twitter [@Maptime Madison](@MaptimeMadison) for more news!
