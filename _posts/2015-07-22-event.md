This month, we are doing something a little different for Maptime. We are going to be available to answer any and all of your mapping questions rather than going through a tutorial or specific aspect of mapping.

Come by The [Bubbler](http://madisonbubbler.org/) on July 22nd and let us help you. Some ideas of how you can use these mapping office hours:
<ul>
<li>Get feedback on a mapping project that you're currently working on.</li>
<li>Come with general questions about maps.</li>
<li>Specific questions about a certain software or application. </li>
<li>Talk through how to get started on a mapping project that you're thinking about. </li>
<li>Play around with some of the topics and tools we've covered in the past, including QGIS, CartoDB, OpenStreetMap, and Leaflet. </li>
</ul>

####We will also have FREE PIZZA provided by [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/). Woo hoo!

###Supplies:

If you have a specific project that you want to take a look at, be sure to bring it (or have it accessible online somewhere so we can look at it using the Bubbler's computers). Otherwise, we have laptops to borrow supplied to us by the Bubbler.  

###Where and When?

July 22nd  6pm - 8pm @ Madison Public Library: Central Library @ the Bubbler
