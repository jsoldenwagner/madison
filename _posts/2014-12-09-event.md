Do you think maps are cool? Do you ever wish that you could edit a map of the world? You can!
At this month's Maptime, we'll learn about [@OpenStreetMaps](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=15/43.0752/-89.3992), a free and editable map of the world (think Google Maps meets Wikipedia). We'll learn from [@Ethan](https://twitter.com/ethan_nelson) about the [@Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](http://hot.openstreetmap.org/)'s work to respond to humanitarian disasters and then [Carl](https://twitter.com/northlandiguana) will teach us how to edit the map ourselves. 
Then we'll get to work and all edit OSM together! 
Be sure to follow us on Twitter to find out about future events: [@Maptime Madison](https://twitter.com/MaptimeMadison).
